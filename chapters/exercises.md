Here are some ideas for more ways you could improve your app. 

* Can you make a thumbnail image appear on the Works listing page, instead of the URL? 
* Can you change the links on the Works page so that they say "AI", "Edit", and "Remove", instead of the boilerplate "Show", "Edit" and "Destroy"?
* Can you create an Author model and associate it to the work? 
* Can you generate a JSON API response for a single work?
