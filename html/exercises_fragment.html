<p>Here are some ideas for more ways you could improve your app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you make a thumbnail image appear on the Works listing page, instead of the URL?
</li>
<li>Can you change the links on the Works page so that they say “AI”, “Edit”, and “Remove”, instead of the boilerplate “Show”, “Edit” and “Destroy”?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Can you create an Author model and associate it to the work?
</li>
<li>Can you generate a JSON API response for a single work?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
