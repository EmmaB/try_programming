<p>There are lots of different programming languages, and more are being created all the time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They are often very specialised.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> COBOL was designed to make it easy to solve business problems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> FORTRAN was, and still is, used to write high-performance scientific programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages" target="_blank">Here</a> is a list of notable languages.</p>
<p>In this course we’ll be using a language called Ruby, which has been around for about 20 years.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ruby became very popular as a language for developing web-based applications about ten years ago, after the release of an “application development framework” written in Ruby, called “Ruby on Rails”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The aim of Ruby on Rails was to make it very easy to develop web based applications by hiding nearly all of the complexity from the developer.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, many more people have contributed further to the ease of developing Ruby on Rails applications by contributing more open source code to help with specific common tasks.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These contributions, known as “gems”, help with tasks such as providing password-based access to systems, validating ISBNs, or allowing users of the system to upload files such as images or documents through the application.</p>
<p>So the trend over the past decade has been to make it easier and easier to solve common tasks by just using code that other people have contributed, making it more simple to write sophisticated applications.</p>
<p>When the application has been written, it used to be the case that you then had to buy or rent a “server” that is connected to the internet, and then install and maintain all of the required software and security configuration.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However another major change has been a recent profusion in companies, such as Amazon and Google, offering rental of their own computers for running code and managing applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Other companies, such as Netflix, run their businesses entirely on rented servers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Furthermore, yet other companies provide management layers on top of these services that hide their complexity from you, making it even easier to run your own application, and because they have a huge customer base of very similar systems, they can do so extremely cheaply.</p>
<p>Until very recently this still left you with the problem of setting up your own computer to develop your application, and this has often been a rather trying business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the past year or two, other companies have developed “hosted” systems that allow you to develop your code on their servers, so you don’t even need to have a sophisticated and complex development environment on your own desktop or laptop computers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Today we will be using a service called “Nitrous” to develop our code.</p>

<span class="description">What is a Rails application?</span></div>
<p class="noindent">When you go to the Scribd website, or the Yellow Pages website, or Airbnb, Groupon or Bloomberg, you’re looking at Ruby on Rails applications.</p>
<p>When you run the code of a Rails application, it generates HTML pages.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Unlike a static HTML website, though, a Rails app can display different data, drawn from a database, depending on what the website user clicks on and types.</p>
<p>So: a Rails application generates HTML pages on the fly.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And what are a bunch of HTML pages usually called?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A website.</p>

</div><p>On Cloud 9’s navigation menu at the top of the page, click on <code>Run project</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll see a server start up in the lower pane.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Click on Preview Running Application at the top, and then a new pane will open.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That is a browser window, and in it you’ll see a website declaring “Welcome aboard.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’re riding Ruby on Rails!”</p>
<p>You’ve done it!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your new Rails application is running.</p>
